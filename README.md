# License Plate Identification System

## Overview

This Python project aims to implement a License Plate Identification System using image processing techniques. The system is designed to take input images containing vehicles and extract license plate information from them.

## Features

- **License Plate Detection:** Utilizes image processing algorithms to detect and locate license plates within a given image.
  
- **Character Recognition:** Implements Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to extract and recognize characters from the detected license plates.

- **User-Friendly Interface:** Provides a simple and easy-to-use interface for users to input images and receive license plate information.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/license-plate-identification.git
    cd license-plate-identification
    ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. Run the main script:

    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

2. Input the path to the image containing the vehicle with a visible license plate.

3. The system will process the image and display the extracted license plate information.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- Tesseract OCR
- Other dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`

Make sure to have these dependencies installed before running the application.
